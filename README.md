# MusikPlayz

It is a self-hosted localhost site which can be deployed but I am not willing to deploy it right now without a proper db and backend. So in short you can request, download and
maintain songs (only if you are an admin).

I personally created this because I was tired of downloading song after 3 hours of search, and out of frustration due to unskippable YT ads anyway, it is a simple site with Django backend and structuring using HTML and design using CSS; most of the backend is with JS by Django.

Anyway, enjoy if you want to every host this in your own have some fun time listening and connect with me if you find any way to deploy it on any site. Right now, I am thinking https://www.render.com but, I will need to see to it.

Cheers, fellow coders!
